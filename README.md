An iOS scheduler app for my Mom

This solves the task of: 
Having M food categories, each with N_1, N_2, ... N_m different dishes respectively.
Each meal must also contains all M food categories.
How should the meals be planned for least repetition? 

I also add customization options, and the ability to change the schedule, which makes keeping track of past dishes harder.
